With over 40 years’ experience with the De Beers Group, he is responsible for setting the standard for all the diamonds used in De Beers’ jewellery, ensuring they are always cut for beauty rather than weight. He started out as a buyer of rough diamonds in Africa in 1972 and almost 20 years ago, was involved in implementing the Kimberley Process that was set up to stop the trade in conflict stones.Andrew recently took a moment out from his world travels to share with Vogue five little-known facts about the world's hardest, sparkliest mineral.\n\n\n 1.No two diamonds are the same \n Natural diamonds are one of the oldest and rarest of nature’s treasures, formed through intense heat and pressure in the earth’s mantle between 800 million and 3.4 billion years ago. They are older than some of the stars in the sky and nature only has a limited supply. Because they were born at different times during the evolution of the earth, they all look and feel very different. They develop a unique character and colour, depending on the surrounding conditions in which they were initially created under, as well as their secret journey from over 300 kilometres beneath the surface of the earth. This makes each diamond truly unique.\n\n 2.You can trust your own eyes\nDiamonds will excite your eyes in different ways as you see the same diamond differently from each eye. The three aspects of visual excitement in a diamond is described by De Beers as Fire, Life and Brilliance. However, the combination that will excite you the most is completely unique to you.Trust your eye, brain and ultimately, your heart’s reaction. At De Beers, we advocate having a very open mind about the 4 Cs - cut, clarity, colour and carat weight - and recommend trying on everything within your ring size and budget regardless of colour, shape, or quality grade. Be prepared for a big surprise! In a sense, the diamond chooses you and when that happens, there is only one thing left to do: fall in love with your diamond for you have found the best one in the world.\n\n 3.The magical history of natural diamonds\nWhen rough diamonds were first found in India over 2,500 years ago, some people felt a mystical power when they touched a diamond. Always cold and hard, they were considered unconquerable, especially as a diamond was so hard that it could not be polished or faceted like other gemstones. In fact, it was only 500 years ago that a way to polish a diamond was found. Rough diamonds were worn as talismans by kings and princes for 2000 years, often sewn into their clothes to protect them in battle.It was only later that diamonds became a symbol of love and the idea of the engagement ring was born. One medieval example of a diamond ring in France was engraved with the words ‘When you do not see me, please think of me.’ Today, the meaning that diamonds convey, continues to evolve, each one as individual as those who either gift a diamond or purchase it to enjoy themselves.\n\n4.Diamonds are really cool\nDiamonds are the coolest gemstones to touch because heat goes in and out of them faster than with any other stone. Diamonds are also the hardest mineral, not only the highest-scoring 10 on the Mohs scale of hardness, but actually four times harder than anything else on earth. Interestingly they do not conduct electricity which may explain why many people constantly touch their diamond jewellery while thinking\n\n 5.Diamonds make the world a sparklier place, but it’s important to treat them with care\nFor most people, the best diamond is the one which sparkles the most but unless you wear the silk glove which you see worn by jewellers, you can reduce the natural transparency and sparkle of your diamond in seconds, every time you handle it with your bare hands. Science tells us that hydrocarbons, oils and greases are naturally attracted to surfaces which do not contain oxygen. Diamond is pure carbon so it provides the perfect surface to stick to — like glue. Professional cleaning by your jeweller is the best way to restore your ring, better than gin, washing up liquid or your ex’s toothbrush. Once you buy a piece of De Beers diamond jewellery, we offer cleaning for life, and if you want to sparkle up your diamond on the go, we recommend using our Instant Diamond Brilliance wipes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t ARTICLE 2 for FASHION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \t\tEvery Romantic Detail Of Note From JFK And Jackie Kennedy’s Wedding  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t BY EMILY CHAN \n\t\t\t\t18 DECEMBER 2019\n\nAs society weddings go, John F Kennedy’s marriage to Jacqueline Lee Bouvier is truly legendary. The future president met the socialite at a dinner party while she was working as the Washington Times-Herald’s “Inquiring Camera Girl” shortly after she graduated from George Washington University in 1951. (A little known fact? That same year, she also won Vogue’s Prix de Paris contest for young writers, the same prize that landed Joan Didion her first job at the magazine in 1956.) The couple dated quietly for two years before JFK, then a Massachusetts senator, proposed shortly after Jackie had returned from covering Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation in London. Below, look back at every detail of the spectacular wedding that followed.\n\nThe Ring\nJackie Kennedy’s engagement ring is one of the most referenced in history. The art-deco Van Cleef & Arpels design included a 2.88-carat diamond and a 2.84-carat emerald – both square cut and surrounded by diamond baguettes. In 1962, the then First Lady had the ring altered, incorporating round and marquise diamonds as well. For the wedding itself, Jackie also wore a diamond and pearl bracelet, gifted to her by JFK the night before the ceremony as her “something new”, as well as a strand of family pearls and a diamond leaf pin given to her by her in-laws.\n\nThe Wedding Party\nThe young senator’s best man was his brother Robert F Kennedy, with an additional 13 ushers – each of whom he presented with a Brooks Brothers umbrella inscribed with the date of the wedding during a rehearsal dinner at Newport’s Seaside Clambake Club. Jackie, on the other hand, had sister Lee Radziwill as her matron-of-honour, with a further 10 bridesmaids, all dressed in pink faille silk dresses and matching Tudor caps. Her stepfather, Hugh D Auchincloss, gave her away.\n\nThe Ceremony\nThe Kennedys were officially married at St Mary’s in Newport, Rhode Island, on the morning of 12 September, 1953, with the Catholic church filled with pink gladioli and white chrysanthemums for the occasion. The Archbishop of Boston performed the ceremony in front of no less than 800 guests, reading a special blessing from Pope Pius XII himself, while thousands of fans waited outside the church, hoping to see the bride and groom. A tenor soloist, Luigi Vena, performed Ave Maria during the service.\n\nThe Wedding Dress\n Jackie turned to Ann Lowe, the trailblazing African American designer, to create her ivory silk taffeta wedding dress, which included a portrait neckline and a bouffant skirt made with more than 50 yards of fabric. Meanwhile, she opted to wear her grandmother’s heirloom rose point lace veil, held in place by clusters of orange blossoms, and carried a bouquet of pink and white spray orchids and gardenias.\n\nThe Reception\nFollowing the ceremony, the bride and groom travelled with a motorcycle escort to the Auchincloss family’s 300-acre estate, Hammersmith Farm, where guests sipped champagne and danced to Meyer Davis and his orchestra against the backdrop of Narragansett Bay. According to a Life reporter sent to cover the event, “The marriage of Washington’s best-looking young senator to Washington’s prettiest inquiring photographer… turned out to be the most impressive the old society stronghold had seen in 30 years… There were 900 guests at the reception, and it took Senator and Mrs Kennedy two hours to shake their hands.” As for the couple’s grand exit for their honeymoon in Acapulco, Mexico? Guests showered the bride and groom with rose petal confetti.\n\nThe Menu\nJFK ordered a five-tier wedding cake from the family-run Plourdes Bakery in Massachusetts, which he frequently visited during his campaign for Senate in 1952 – with the finished product measuring nearly three feet tall. The wedding luncheon also included a fruit salad served in hollowed out pineapple halves; creamed chicken; and ice cream, carved into the shape of roses, for pudding.");

The finished result of her festive manicure called to mind a wrapped and ready holiday gift.It’s an easy look to recreate, too. Try a red like Essie's Scarlet Starlet with CND’s Vinylux Longwear Polish in Emerald Lights to achieve a similar effect.However, it wasn’t only Swift’s nails that tapped into the festive season and offered Christmas party beauty inspiration. Her bright red lip, a Swift signature, was stamped on that little bit brighter than usual, and was paired with a very Cats-appropriate feline flick of eyeliner plus an Oscar de la Renta dress.A purr-fect look, by all accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE:2 for BEAUTY\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKendall Jenner’s Signature Dark Locks Are No More\n\t\t\t\t\tBY HANNAH COATES\n\t\t\t\t\t17 DECEMBER 2019\n\n\nWhile most opt to go that little bit darker with their hair for winter, Kendall Jenner has taken her brunette mane a lighter shade of brown just in time for Christmas. Debuting the new hue in an Instagram video on Monday, Jenner ran her hands through her freshly coloured hair.\nA few shades lighter than her usual raven locks, the new coffee-brown hue is a natural one – more sun-kissed than lightened-in-salon – and Jenner paired it with the ultimate matte red lipstick and the caption, “I’m sleepy”.The woman behind her new colour is Cassondra Kaeding, a Redken brand ambassador who works out of Los Angeles’s 454 Salon, and who has dyed the hair of everyone from Natalie Portman to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.The subtle revamp is a far cry from the platinum blonde the model showed off back in September whilst walking the Burberry spring/summer 2020 show, a dramatic look she quickly eschewed to return to her hair comfort zone: the dark side.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSelena Gomez Demonstrates The Transformative Power Of A Good Fringe\n\t\t\t\t\tBY HANNAH COATES\n\t\t\t\t\t12 DECEMBER 2019\n\n\nThey say when in a city, do as the inhabitants do, and when Selena Gomez touched down in London this week, that is exactly what she did. Well, with her hair, that is.\nWith new wispy bangs, worn parted at the centre, and a choppy, layered, shoulder-length bob, Gomez stepped out with hair that was much reminiscent of a certain Briton, Alexa Chung.\nThe ‘shag’, which was cut by hairstylist Marissa Marino especially for Gomez’s trip to London, was expertly feathered around her face; both flattering and sophisticated at once, it framed Gomez’s face immaculately and disproved the myth that those with round-shaped faces can't pull off a fringe. Hers was a shining example that it can.During various outings in the British capital, she wore her fringe with everything from double denim to a Burberry black, leopard print-lined trench coat and she was rarely without her ‘70s-style Ray Bans.");

For Stormzy, the pressure to meet expectations is arguably greater than most, as his 2017 studio debut, Gangs, Signs & Prayer received raving reviews from critics, broke UK streaming records (earning 13.9 million streams in its first week to be exact), was named as one of only four artists to have had all tracks from an album rank in the UK top 100 (seven of which held solid places in the top 40 for consecutive weeks), was crowned the first grime album to make UK number one and went on to win the prestigious British Album of the Year award in 2018.\nGangs, Signs & Prayer was no doubt a magisterial masterpiece that saw Stormzy make his mark in the music industry and in history. What, how, and if the 26 year-old would deliver with his next album, titled Heavy Is The Head since its announcement was a hot topic of discussion amongst critics and fans alike. Ahead of the album released today, Vogue listened to all sixteen tracks from start and finish, and we can confirm that it is just, if not more masterful than his first. Here is everything you need to know about the grime extraordinaire’s latest opus.\nGangs, Signs & Prayer was no doubt a magisterial masterpiece that saw Stormzy make his mark in the music industry and in history.

Ahead of the album released today, Vogue listened to all sixteen tracks from start and finish, and we can confirm that it is just, if not more masterful than his first. Here is everything you need to know about the grime extraordinaire’s latest opus.\nEvery track is an anthem\nThe sixteen track album is a symphonious, triumphant affair, as Stormzy pushes his own musical and emotional boundaries, showcasing the many flavours and layers to his musical ability. Surprisingly, the album is dominated by tracks that one wouldn’t necessarily consider ‘quintessentially ‘Stormzy’ (upbeat, head bopping-inducing grime with heavy instrumentals and provocative lyrics), which if anything, is the album’s strength. Instead, a focus on tonality, musicality, instrumentals and vocals is clear, as he unexpectedly experiments with melding genres such as R&B, pop, soul, nineties/noughties sounds – even sampling hip-hop, jazz, gospel with rap and grime – a daring move that has paid off as it is these tracks that are his finest and far from a commercial sellout move. Each song carries a different musical theme, but are all grand in their own right, seamlessly flowing from one another. No doubt every track, as they did on Gangs, Signs & Prayer will make its way to the charts.");

                printf("\t\t\t\t\t ARTICLE:1 for catwalk\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDolce & Gabbana - Alta Sartoria\n\n we don’t know why we got permission to show here,” Stefano Gabbana said before his and Domenico Dolce’s Alta Sartoria show in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana. “No one ever showed here before,” he paused, dumbfounded. “But we got it.” For their savoir-faire shows, the designers become location method dressmakers, allowing the frames of the collection they’re going to show to inform the collection. A hidden jewel in Milan, the museum was founded by Cardinal Borromeo in 1609 on the principle of “doing it for the public,” as Gabbana explained. “He started to collect books around the world to give the people the possibility to learn about everything in the world. And this is the best message: we can work to give something to the people, not just for ourselves.”One of the first pieces in Borromeo’s collection was a still life painting of a fruit bowl by Caravaggio – “Canestra di Frutta” – which Dolce and Gabbana transferred onto a cape with an astrakhan collar for the second look in the collection, preceded by a scarlet cassock in homage to the collector himself. This was a literal collection, and that was precisely the point. “Classic beauty,” Dolce said. “We need beauty to make life better.” Renaissance art, of course, is the gift that keeps on giving. Anyone who seeks out the Italian museums that house the masterpieces and the secrets of this era will know that you can never be educated enough about – or overwhelmed enough with – the works of the Renaissance. For Dolce and Gabbana, their most recent obsession came courtesy of Giovanni Battista Moroni, who features within the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana and perhaps most notably painted the “The Tailor”, which belongs to the National Gallery.Parts of the 115 looks that made up the Alta Sartoria collection were inspired by Moroni. And while many of these clothes operate in hyper-opulence – gilded embroideries with gems and cloths printed like painted Renaissance canvases – it was in the sophistication of delicately coloured tailoring (and especially a handful of pristine coats that navigated within dusty royal blues and purples) that Moroni’s genetics were most beautifully communicated and interpreted for contemporary times. Alta Sartoria, though, isn’t about the simplicity of an instantly desirable cashmere coat. This “men’s couture” collection is a theatre for the private dandy client, who communicates his modern majesty through the intricate, almost impossible-looking craftsmanship of his clothes. That premise sets some delightful challenges for Dolce and Gabbana on a seasonal basis.This time, they created new trompe l’oeils with plume in neatly storied quills on tops and tailoring – so three-dimensional the effect flickered before your eyes – and in a wealth of fur techniques that played on intarsia impacts or metallic dyes that created optical illusions. It was a feast for the eyes of the client, who flies himself to these shows to buy his seasonal multi-gazillionaire wardrobe. For the rest of us, it was the kind of fashion you just have to sit back and enjoy: so sensorily stimulating you’d be silly not to surrender to its lavishness, much like visiting a Renaissance palazzo or indulging in a princely banquet. “We love for the new man to have a vision about beauty and art,” Gabbana said. Whether you’d want to wear it or not, hang it on your wall, or just marvel as its intricacy, his and Dolce’s message was hard to resist.\nby ANDERS CHRISTIAN MADSEN");

While running errands in the city, she opted for a sleek satin suit in the sugary shade with a raspberry shirt underneath. She offset her blush tailoring with a camel coat (a current celeb go-to), a red croc bag, beige pumps, large gold hoops and tinted shades.\nChopra has incorporated a handful of immaculately cut suits into her wardrobe of late. Earlier this month at the Marrakech International Film Festival, the actor, who was honoured for her contribution to film over the past 20 years, wore white Prabal Gurung separates, which she contrasted with a berry-stained lip. The star – who is currently filming The White Tiger, an adaptation of Aravind Adiga’s Man Booker prize-winning novel of the same title – has worn pieces by Gurung on several occasions, but suiting by the Nepalese-American designer is new for the star.\nLooking ahead to next year, Chopra and her husband Nick Jonas are teaming up to produce an unscripted series for Amazon, which will follow engaged couples as they prepare for their Sangeets. In short, a Sangeet occurs the night before a wedding and involves family and friends dancing the night away. “We re-watched the video of our Sangeet last week on our first anniversary, and the togetherness of our family and friends during this event still sparks the same warmth and excitement that it did just over a year ago at our wedding,” said Chopra Jonas of her Indian wedding last year. “The Sangeet is a centuries-old Indian wedding tradition, that not only celebrates the union of two people, but also signifies the introduction and bonding of two families coming together in a marriage.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE: 2 for NEWS\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJennifer Lawrence Wears Another Trophy Coat For A Day At The Museum\n\t\t\t\t\tBY SUSAN DEVANEY\n\t\t\t\t\t18 DECEMBER 2019\n\n ver the winter months, Jennifer Lawrence has been using a luxurious pale palette to elevate her daywear. Last month, the Oscar-winning actor wore a white wool belted mid-length coat for a day out in New York City. Yesterday, she took Burberry’s yellow “Willingstone” teddy coat for a spin at the MET Museum. Underneath? A light grey turtleneck, monochrome plaid skirt, a pair of The Row combat boots (her current staple) and a Khaite “Aimee” clutch in caramel suede.\nLawrence and her husband Cooke Maroney, who split their time between New York and Los Angeles, strolled through the streets of NYC arm-in-arm. The Hunger Games star and her art dealer partner recently exchanged vows at a lavish ceremony in Newport, Rhode Island. Lawrence, who reportedly wore Dior for the big day, said “I do” during a service at the Belcourt of Newport mansion, a 40,000sq ft estate with a sprawling ballroom space. Celebrities such as Cameron Diaz, Kris Jenner, Adele, Nicole Richie and Emma Stone were in attendance.\nLike Lawrence, Katie Holmes has also been wearing a cosy teddy coat this winter. Her caramel-coloured Max Mara version has been on rotation with other outerwear, because one coat is never enough when the paparazzi have a proclivity for capturing you on the streets daily.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t ARTICLE:3 for NEWS\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEmma Watson Really Wants Us To Read This Book Before Christmas\n\t\t\t\t\tBY SUSAN DEVANEY\n\t\t\t\t\t16 DECEMBER 2019\n\nEmma Watson is an avid reader.

The company refers to Snapdragon 865 as a “mobile platform” solution because indeed, in conjunction with its Snapdragon X55 modem, it provides a comprehensive flagship 5G smartphone silicon solution, from core processors to the to modem, RF transceiver and RF front end, that’s both mmWave (Millimeter Wave) and Sub-6 compatible for operation with virtually any carrier network. 5G interoperability is a must-have for any next generation flagship mobile device, but so-too is top end performance. To that end, Qualcomm also re-architected the primary processing engines on board the Snapdragon 865 such that the company is claiming a healthy 25 percent performance uplift in core compute and gaming/graphics workloads, along with up to a 4X increase in TOPS performance in AI workloads, coupled with higher efficiency to boot.Snapdragon 865's new Kryo 585 CPU engine is comprised of a quad-core, high-performance arm Cortex-A77 complex, along with a quad-core block of low-power arm Cortex-A55 cores. One of the Cortex-A77 cores, dubbed the Prime core has a beefed-up 512K of L2 cache and also a higher boost clock than the other high performance cores, at 2.8GHz versus 2.4GHz. The Prime core is intended to bolster single-threaded workloads to improve general responsiveness. This big/little architecture has been common among arm mobile silicon solutions for many years but arm’s 64-bit Cortex-A77 is new this year, offering wider instruction fetch (6-wide up from 4-wide), increased memory bandwidth and other enhancements.  One additional take-away here is that Qualcomm is obviously focused on balanced performance, not only multithreaded, but single-threaded responsiveness as well.Qualcomm didn’t dive too deep on its new Adreno 650 GPU engine, except to note that it will deliver up to 25 percent more performance, but Snapdragon 865 also supports up to 16GB of 2750MHz LPDDR5 memory for a nice kicker in memory bandwidth, which is always key for graphics-intensive workloads. Finally, machine learning at the edge, or EdgeML, is big these days, as mobile and smart IoT devices need to gather, analyze and quantify more data than ever before. As such, QCOM also introduced its new Hexagon 698 AI processing engine in Snapdragon 865, with enhanced Tensor processing cores for the AI lift I noted earlier. All told, it appears as if Snapdragon 865 will allow the Android army to give the other major mobile device platforms, from Apple to Huawei, a run for their money, but how do all these speeds, feeds and core counts translate to real world performance?Marco Chiappetta over at HotHardware has an early preview look of Snapdragon 865 performance with an advanced prototype provided by Qualcomm for testing. The 5.9-inch device was running Android 10 and was also backed up by 12GB of LPDDR5 and 128GB of internal Flash storage. The device had two modes of operation, Normal and Performance, the latter of which allows Snapdragon 865 the ability to ramp up quicker, moving workloads from its little arm cores to its big arm Cortex-A77 cores.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE 2: for INNOVATION\n\n\n\t\tCanva Uncovered: How A Young Australian Kitesurfer Built A $3.2 Billion (Profitable!) Startup Phenom\n\non a steamy May morning in 2013, Canva CEO Melanie Perkins found herself adrift on a kiteboard in the channel between billionaire Richard Branson’s private Necker and Moskito islands.Her 30-foot sail floating deflated and useless beside her in the strong eastern Caribbean current, the 26-year-old entrepreneur waited for hours to be rescued. As she treaded water, her left leg scarred by a past collision with a coral reef, she reminded herself that her dangerous new hobby was worth it. After all, it was key to the fundraising strategy for the design-software startup she’d cofounded with her boyfriend six years before.Canva was based in Australia, thousands of miles from tech’s Silicon Valley power corridor. Getting a meeting—much less funding—was proving tough. Perkins heard “no” from more than 100 investors. So when she met the organizer of a group of kitesurfing venture capitalists at a pitch competition in her native Perth, Perkins got to training. The next time the group met to hear startup pitches and potentially write crucial early-stage funding checks, she’d have a seat at the table—even if it meant having to brave treacherous waters.“It was like, risk: serious damage; reward: start company,” Perkins says. If you get your foot in the door just a tiny bit, you have to kind of wedge it all the way in.\nSuch perseverance has long been a necessity at Canva, which began as a modest yearbook-design business in the state capital of Perth on Australia’s west coast. From those remote origins, Canva has grown into a global juggernaut. Twenty-million-plus users from 190 countries use the company’s “freemium” Web-based app to design everything from splashy Pinterest graphics to elegant restaurant menus. Besides an impossible-to-beat price (millions of users pay nothing at all), Canva’s key advantage over rival products from tech giants like Adobe has been its ease of use. Before Canva, amateurs had to stitch together designs in Microsoft Word or pay through the nose for confusing professional tools. Today, anyone, anywhere, can download Canva and be creating within ten minutes. The company’s revenue comes from upselling to a $10-a-month premium version with snazzier features or, more recently, from sales of a streamlined corporate account option. High-quality stock photos—of which Canva has millions—cost another $1. It adds up. This year the company expects to more than double its revenue to $200 million; its most recent $85 million funding round valued it at $3.2 billion. Perkins, now 32 and an alum of the 2016 Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list, has an estimated 15% stake, valued at $430 million. Throw in her 34-year-old cofounder—and now fiancé—Cliff Obrecht’s similar stake, and the Aussie power couple are likely worth more than $800 million.\nSuch perseverance has long been a necessity at Canva, which began as a modest yearbook-design business in the state capital of Perth on Australia’s west coast.

                printf("\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE:1 for LEADERSHIP:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn A Historic Bill, Federal Workers Will Receive 12 Weeks Of Paid Parental Leave\n\nIn the bizarre way that the United States government works, the Senate passed a bill on Tuesday, tucked into the budget of the National Defense Authorization Act (authorizing a new Space Force branch of the Armed Services), providing all federal workers with 12 weeks of paid parental leave for the first time in American history.The bill, which was lightly covered in the media due to the impeachment hearings, will offer all federal workers 12 weeks of paid parental leave—coinciding with the birth, adoption or fostering of a child. First passed by Congress and this week’s vote in the Senate, the bill will now be brought before President Donald Trump to sign. This monumental policy will commence in October 2020. Federal employees will need to work for the U.S. government for at least a year to become eligible for the benefits. They will also have to return back to work for at least 12 weeks after they take their leave. The initial version of the bill called for also providing paid time off for employees who need to care for sick adult relatives or tend to their own medical issues. However, this draft did not garner sufficient bipartisan support.The U.S. is unique in that it's the sole industrialized nation that has refused to adopt a policy of parental leave for its federal employees up to this point. The U.S. currently has the Family Medical Leave Act, which requires employers with 50 and more employees to give parents 12 weeks of leave to care for a new child. The corporations are not mandated to offer any guaranteed pay for their employees who take time off from work. Over 2 million Americans are believed to benefit from this new policy. By comparison, only 19% of U.S. non-government workers have access to paid family leave through their employers. This gives rise to questions from some people over the fairness of the act. Is it appropriate for government employees, who are paid by taxpayers, to receive such an important benefit that is not widely offered to the majority of working people? The Congressional Budget Office estimates it could cost about $8.1 billion over the next 10 years—funded by workers who don’t have this right. This does not take away from the importance of the bill, but there should be some thought and consideration for those who are not fortunate enough to receive such a benefit.Similar policies have already been adopted by many large, leading companies in the U.S. The hope is that other corporations will follow the government’s lead and offer this benefit to their employees too. Wide adoption is questionable as many small-to-midsize organizations don’t have the financial and personnel resources to offer such a program—even if they wanted to. An unintended consequence may be that people will seek out jobs with the government or large, deep-pocketed companies and leave smaller firms. This will put more power into the hands of companies, such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple and the U.S. government, while weakening smaller companies that are unable to offer this program. They will most likely lose their best and brightest employees to their bigger rivals.  It is expected for Trump to sign the bill, as his daughter, Ivanka Trump, was a prominent proponent of the bill. Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Representative Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), the new chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, have all championed this cause.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE :2 for LEADERSHIP:\n\n\n\t\tCollege Enrollment Declines Again. It’s Down More Than Two Million Students In This Decade.\n\nThe fall 2019 postsecondary enrollment numbers have been tabulated, and the news is once again sure to concern college leaders. Overall, postsecondary enrollments decreased by 1.3% in fall 2019, a drop of more than 231,000 students from last year. That’s according to the the Fall 2019 Current Term Enrollment Estimates report from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. (Institutions that submit enrollment data to the Clearinghouse account for 97% of all enrollments at Title IV, degree-granting institutions.For the first time this decade, the nation’s fall semester’s unduplicated enrollments dipped below 18 million, a decline of more than 2 million students since its peak in 2011.Added to that top-line result are several findings that provide specific insights into where the decreases (and some increases) are occurring.Fifteen states saw enrollment increases. Utah led the nation with an increase of nearly 16,800 students, a 4.9% uptick from last year. The other states with enrollment increases were: Arizona (1.8%), Delaware (0.3%), Georgia (1.5%), Kentucky (1.5%), Louisiana (0.6%), Mississippi (0.3%), Nebraska (0.4%), Nevada (0.3%), New Hampshire (3.4%), North Carolina (0.6%), Rhode Island (0.3%), South Carolina (0.1%), Tennessee (0.6%), and Texas (0.3%).The remaining states suffered enrollment decreases.Florida had the largest decline with a drop of 52,328 students. It was followed by New York (-19,386), California (-19,272), Missouri (-14,869) and Pennsylvania (-14,799).In terms of percentage decreases, the top states were: Alaska (-10.6%), Florida (-5.3%), Arkansas (-4.9%), Missouri (-4.4%), Wyoming (-4.4%) and Vermont (-4.4%).\nAll sectors experienced declines.Among higher education sectors, the largest percentage decrease was at private for-profit four-year institutions, which shrunk by 15,711 students or 2.1%. It was followed by public two-year institutions, where enrollment declined by 77,092 students or 1.4%; public four-year institutions, whose enrollment dropped by 97,426 students or 1.2%; and private nonprofit four-year institutions, which fell by 22,027 students, 0.6%.The report noted that enrollment at large private nonprofit four-year institutions actually grew 2.7%, although those with less than 10,000 students declined.\nGraduate and professional education saw a small enrollment increase.While undergraduate enrollment decreased by 1.7% year over year, graduate and professional enrollment edged up by .8% from 2018 to 2019.\nEnrollment declines were greater for men, part-timers and older students. \nAbout 159,000 fewer men (-2.0%) and nearly 84,000 fewer women (-.8%) enrolled in 2019 compared to 2018.Enrollment decreases were more than twice as large for part-time students (-2.1%) compared to those attending full-time (-.9%).Enrollment declined 1% for students between the ages of 18 and 24, but it dived by 6% for students older than 24. One bit of good news was that enrollment of dual-enrolled students under the age of 18 increased by 36,660, almost 6%, at public two-year colleges. The average age of full-time, undergraduate students has dropped from 22.3 to 21.8 years over the past four years.\nSTEM majors saw declines as did the humanities.Enrollments continued to slide downward in English (-5%) and liberal arts and sciences, general studies and the humanities (-7.1%), but what was less expected were decreases in several STEM majors, which are typically seen as better pathways to good job prospects. Four-year majors in health sciences were off by 2.1%, as were majors in physical sciences -4.6 science technologies -2.6%, engineering (-1.6%), math (-1.2%), biological sciences (-.9%).\nImplicationsIf anyone needed further proof that higher education continues to battle strong headwinds, these enrollment numbers should suffice. A shrinking population of high school graduates combined with a spate of institutional scandals, widespread anxiety about the costs of college and mountains of student debt, increasing skepticism about the value and necessity of college, growing concerns about the fairness of the admissions process, and a widening partisan divide between Republicans and Democrats over whether colleges are politically biased have taken a toll on Americans’ perceptions—and their participation—in college.The problem of sagging enrollments should not be dismissed merely as a demographic inevitability or a failure of higher education to tell its story well. It’s more than bad messaging. Colleges and universities have work to do to regain the public’s confidence. Here are four areas where they could start:Work with governors and state legislatures to design effective performance funding models, where public institutions are funded not merely for larger enrollments, but for achieving desirable goals like greater retention, better student learning, and increased degree completion. Commitments to performance funding must also be matched by states appropriating more funding for their public colleges.Revamp institutional financial aid so that all, or most of it, is distributed on the basis of students’ financial need, rather than what’s deemed to be “merit,” simplistically equated with standardized test scores and high-school grades. These days almost every college president stresses the importance of “making college affordable,” but if they aren’t spending most of their financial aid dollars helping students with financial need, they aren’t putting their money where their message is.Reduce the subsidy that nearly all institutions annually plow into intercollegiate athletic programs. All but a couple dozen institutions lose money—and lots of it—on intercollegiate athletics. Whether alumni and donors like it or not, subsidies for college sports are not sustainable, and they are draining hundreds of millions of dollars away from the educational investments that colleges could otherwise be making.Make undergraduate learning an institutional priority. As important as original scholarship and community service are, the primary mission of colleges should be to educate undergraduates well, coupling high academic standards and rigorous curricula with strong support services that prepare graduates for successful lives and productive careers. The general public may not always fully appreciate research and service activities by our colleges and universities, but they will accept them as long as they don’t come at the expense of putting students first.");

                printf("\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE:1 for business:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Real Story Behind The PNC-Venmo Clash\n\nOBSERVATIONS FROM THE FINTECH SNARK TANKFinextra reported that “PNC Bank has been inundated with complaints from customers who have been left unable to connect their accounts to the Venmo app after a security update from the bank locked out data aggregator Plaid.”The bank’s response to complaints and requests for help:\nWhy is PNC doing this? According to its head of retail banking, When aggregators access account numbers, many store them indefinitely, often unbeknownst to customers. This puts customers and their money at risk. We want to make sure we know who is setting up the account.\nWhat The Media Thinks the Story Is\nReactions to PNC’s move have focused mostly on data aggregation and open banking:Finextra wrote: “The dispute is part of a wider battle between banks and fintech upstarts over access to customer data. Plaid has grown into a multi-billion dollar company in just few years by tapping into increasing consumers demand to share their bank data with third party apps.”Quoted in a CNBC article, Karen Mills, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School said “the PNC-Venmo spat shows how much we need to adopt open banking that lets customers own their own data.The Media is WrongPNC may be correct about the risk involved in data aggregators’ data management approaches. But the bank is a member of the Financial Data Exchange which is committed to “enhancing consumer controls of financial data through an API and technical standards that prioritize security, transparency and user experience.”\nIn other words, PNC is committed to sharing data and “open banking.”Venmo-related security concerns is a bit of a red herring, however.\nIn October 2018, American Banker reported that “one banker said that soon after his firm launched Zelle, fraud skyrocketed so high he had to go into the office at midnight to shut the system down.”And in fact, PNC struggled itself with Zelle-related fraud. A May 2018 Digital Transactions article reported that Zelle-related “hit double digit basis points of payment volume” for a period of time.The bank was able to take steps to reduce the fraud rate. But that begs the question: If PNC can take corrective actions, why can’t the data aggregators?\nThe Real Story\nTo Finextra’s point, there is a battle over access to customer data. But that’s not what’s going on here. And while open banking might enable consumers to own their own data (or at least better manage their data), that, too, is not what the PNC-Venmo spat is all about.\nWhat the story is about is Zelle’s quest for P2P payment dominance.\nAs I wrote earlier this year in Venmo Versus Zelle: Who's Winning The P2P Payments War?, consumers who use P2P payment apps typically use multiple services—and they’ll choose the app that is most convenient for them at the moment they want to transact.That’s not good enough for Zelle, or for PNC, apparently.The bank is betting that its customers will switch P2P providers before they switch checking accounts. Considering the pain involved with switching accounts, this might not be a bad bet.\nWill Other Zelle Banks Follow Suit?\nTwo weeks ago, JPMorgan Chase announced an agreement with data aggregator Envestnet | Yodlee to share data—but give Chase customers better control over it.This comes a little more than a year after the bank announced a data sharing deal with Plaid to enable customers to more easily share data outside the bank.Seemingly committed to data sharing and “open banking,” will Chase shut down connections to Plaid (and therefore Venmo)? Will other Zelle banks follow suit?They’ll be watching what happens with PNC, for sure. If PNC sees limited account attrition, other Zelle banks will be likely to follow.Never Underestimate Consumer Ingenuit \nIf Zelle banks do shut down access to Plaid in order to subvert Venmo, they may win the P2P battle, but might end up losing the banking war.Here’s my bet: PNC will see very little account attrition resulting from the bank’s actions.To be sure, some customers will change their P2P payment preferences.but many others will simply open additional checking accounts with the Chimes and Money Lions of the world—while leaving their PNC accounts open.They’ll move money from PNC to those other players via ACH or other methods—and continue using Venno through those accounts.And who knows, maybe they’ll start using those fintech firms’ debit cards, as well.Zelle’s quest for dominance is going to have some interesting consequences.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE:2 for business:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReview: ‘Cats’ Is Every Bit As Terrible And Wonderful As You Hoped\n\nLook, Cats is a relatively faithful adaptation of Cats. The Andrew Lloyd Weber musical, based on on T.S. Eliot’s 1939 poetry collection Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats was arguably the first modern “blockbuster” musical of its era. It was as popular for as long as it was not entirely because of quality. It offered stage-bound spectacle and fantasy, with ridiculously talented performers singing and dancing as humanoid cats. It was the one show to which everyone could take their kids, especially tourists wanting to expose their youngsters to a Broadway show.Folks have been making fun of Cats, its lack of a coherent narrative, its random digressions, its frankly mediocre songs (save for maybe “Memories”) and its sheer absurdity for at least as long as it has existed. So, when I say that Tom Hooper’s Cats absolutely captures what’s great and terrible about the show, you can take that for what it’s worth.Yes, Cats is every bit as incomprehensible on screen as it was in theaters. It was the kind of show where I (as a kid) had a theater program synopsis sitting in front of me and still struggled to discern what was happening at any given moment. That I’m not inclined to bend over backward to be fair to this unquestionably unique bit of cinema lunacy is partially because the songs aren’t great, and thus the film isn’t terrible engrossing over the long haul\nIt’s one thing when you’re The Greatest Showman and your songs are so damn catchy that I can still hum them two years later. Save for one or two exceptions, the Cats tunes have always been the opposite of ear worms. Yes, ‘Memories” is great, and I was always fond of Macavity Mr. Mistoffelees. But these aren’t Weber’s best songs, and this certainly isn’t his most disciplined narrative.The hook is pretty simple: several cats existing in some kind of cat purgatory (Are they already dead? I’m not sure.) explain their life stories via song in the hopes that they will be the one chosen to be reincarnated and hopefully have a better life than they did last time. That’s laid out pretty succinctly in the opening reel, and then we’re off to the races. What follows isn’t so much a narrative as it is (like the stage play) a series of almost stand-alone musical numbers where each main cat (played by the likes of Rebel Wilson, James Cordon, Ian McKellen and Jennifer Hudson) gets their turn to make their case.Francesca Hayward plays our audience surrogate while Judi Dench is the one who will choose the winner, and Idris Elba plays the villainous Macavity. Macavity’s big song, sung not by the villain himself but by his proverbial Harley Quinn, goes to Taylor Swift. She also wrote a surprisingly good new tune, “Beautiful Ghosts,” which is Hayward’s big power ballad.\nOn one hand, Swift shows up just long enough to get one of the best songs, but she also generously (?) co-wrote a strong number for someone else. Come what may, it’s better than any of the “new” songs in Aladdin or The Lion King. Anyway, in terms of acting, everyone is having a grand old time, but McKellen stands out by taking it quite seriously. He’s like Michael Caine in A Christmas Carol giving 104% even while acting alongside the Muppets. Elba has his fun too, while Hudson is there strictly to belt “Memories.”This all plays out with actors singing and dancing as living cats thanks to the magic of special effects. Is this 100% authentic? No, but it mostly sells the illusion and looks about as real as you’re going to get without turning this into The Lion King. The production design, even with an inconsistency of scale worthy of Night of the Lepus, is amusing and occasionally enchanting, with the cats in question floundering about amid giant real world sets that sometimes looks like a very expensive episode of Sesame Street.Whether you think Cats is rum-tum-terrific or rum-tum-terrible is largely about whether you have any interest in a Cats movie. I imagine many of my fellow critics, especially those with little knowledge of the stage play, reacted in horror and amazement, and this flick is almost certain to become a camp classic along the lines of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Again, this is not a “good” movie, but it’s a faithful rendition, warts and all, of a stage property that ran for decades. If you wanted a star-studded Cats movie, well, here you go.");

Croatia\nToday In: Lifestyle\nAccording to Virtuoso, a luxury travel network with a reputation for accurately forecasting travel trends, Croatia is one of its top emerging destinations for the upcoming year. Croatia offers a range of activities and you should definitely try to see as much of the country as possible while there.The capital of Croatia, Zagreb, is located inland and encompasses a medieval town and many museums. Meanwhile, the coastal Dubrovnik, possibly more well known as a shooting location for Game of Thrones, offers lovely architecture from a range of eras. \n2. Antarctica\nAs travel to all corners of the globe becomes more accessible, you might find yourself considering destinations that you’d never thought of before, such as Antarctica. New tour providers, cruises and more make visiting the icy adventure destination a possibility.It’s becoming popular with not only adventurers but families as well. Activities you can expect during an Antarctic expedition including penguin watching, whale watching, kayaking, camping, scuba diving and visits to Antarctic research stations. \n3. Bilbao\nBarcelona and Madrid have received traveler attention for a long time, but what about Bilbao, Spain? According to Airbnb, Bilbao has seen a 402 percent year-over-year increase in bookings. It’s attracting travelers not only thanks to its popular Guggenheim Museum but also with its sporting events, culinary scene and culture. Don’t think that the Guggenheim is the only museum the town offers, though.Try the Museum of Fine Arts of Bilbao as well. Make a stop at some of the city’s cathedrals and plenteous pintxos bars.\n4. Vanuatu \nYou may have never heard of this Pacific island chain before, but you will soon. Vanuatu is an archipelago located a few thousand miles east of Australia. The 80 islands boast 100 native languages and plenty of adventure activities to inspire intrepid travelers, including snorkeling, hiking, scuba diving and exploring the wreckage of World War II-era ships, like the SS President Coolidge.Of course, if you’re not up for an activity and would prefer to relax, you can do that, too, on the popular white, sandy beaches. Champagne Beach is a favorite for many visitors. \n5. Quadra Island\nSpeaking of intrepid travelers, brand Intrepid Travel analyzed its booking trends to predict some of the hottest destinations for 2020. It named Quadra Island, British Columbia, as one of the top places to visit in the coming year. The site off Vancouver Island is known as a premier place to whale watch, and there are plenty of tour providers that offer water activities such as kayaking.Camping and hiking are also popular, as is visiting the Cape Mudge Lighthouse. If you’re not too keen on outdoor activities, this trending travel spot might not be for you. But, you can still enjoy learning about the culture and history of Quadra Island at the Nuyumbalees Cultural Center. \n6. Benin\nWhen governments pour money into tourism, travelers do seem to follow. We’ve seen it with destinations such as Egypt and now we’re seeing it with Benin, West Africa. The country gave the world voodoo, but it offers more than just that cultural significance.You can also explore the historical museum in the capital of the long-standing Dahomey Kingdom (which existed for three hundred years), as well as the two historical royal palaces. One boasts a rather morbid attraction that some may enjoy — a throne made of human skulls. If you’d rather see the horrors (and wonders) of the animal kingdom than mankind, book a safari in the country’s Pendjari National Park.\n7. Salta\nBooking.com recognized Salta, Argentina, as a trending destination for 2020. The mountainous town offers something for every type of traveler. Those who are fans of urban exploration can enjoy the cultural hub and historic architecture, while adventurers and active explorers can venture outside the city to soak in the abundant nature and wildlife.One of the top spots in the city is Plaza 9 De Julia, a plaza that dates back to the 1500s, where you can find quaint cafes and museums. Don’t miss the Museum of High Altitude Archaeology, as well as the elegant cathedrals and convents.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE:2 for LIFESTYLE:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFive Cars From The Last Decade That Were Ahead Of Their Time\n\nTiming is everything in the automotive industry. Constantly fluctuating gas prices, market preferences and an ever-advancing technological landscape mean that every move or investment into research and development towards something  “new” is a high-stakes gamble. Sure, right now, SUVs and crossovers are the safe bet profit margin-wise and manufactures are doubling down on those segments for that exact reason. The other side of that coin is when a brand unveils a model pioneering a certain ethos, design or technology with masterstroke potential only to have it fail. Somethings have their moment in the spotlight, fail and are never heard from again. Gullwing doors make a comeback every three decades or so, but innovations like the fifth-wheel parking concept or turbine engine cars are best left to the pages of history books. However, what has to hurt the most is when a car turns heads (for good or bad) upon release, then ceases production due to poor sales or reception, only to see similar cars come along a few years later and enjoy fantastic success. It’s the automotive equivalent of telling a funny joke in a group of friends, no one hearing you, then someone else says the exact same thing and gets the laughs. Just like delivering a punchline, timing is everything. These five cars from 2010-2019 missed the beat and were just too ahead of their time for their own good.\nHonda Accord Crosstour\nHonda branded it a “wagon,” but in person, the Honda Accord Crosstour seemed to slot in between a crossover and a standard wagon. The “sporty” sloped rear hatch made it a bit of an odd-ball in 2010 and because of slow sales, Honda gave it the Crosstour the ax in 2016. If Honda just waited three more years, it would’ve looked like a trendsetter. The Crosstour’s silhouette is now all the rage with luxury manufacturers. Some of the best selling models from BMW and Mercedes are Sedans, SUVs and crossovers sporting that weird-for-2016 coupe-like design. \nFirst Generation Tesla Roadster\nTesla has, without a doubt, single-handedly transformed the world’s perception of electric cars. They used to be uncompetitive and unattractive. Now, all-electric models are making their way into almost every luxury manufacturer’s line up and regularly bully gas-powered performance models on the track. And that’s all thanks to the Model S, Tesla’s second car. The Tesla Roadster is making a comeback in 2020, but the first generation Roadster which ran from 2008-2012, was the brand’s first attempt at making the electric car cool. It showed great potential but was ultimately the victim of the lesser battery technology at the time, sadly. \nCTS-V Sport Wagon\n ");

On this, Putin said: “They will be unlikely to remove a representative of their own party from office on what seems to me an absolutely far-fetched reason.”\nKey background: Last night, House Democrats, with two exceptions, voted to impeach Trump and passed two articles charging him with “high crimes and misdemeanors”: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats allege that Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, his potential rival for the presidency in 2020. They also accuse Trump of obstructing Congress, through his efforts to stop aides from testifying in private and public hearings that stretched over two months.\nWhat to watch for: 2020 is set to start with a Senate trial, which is expected to be fast and lead to an acquittal. But the journey to get there could result in a deadlock. Following yesterday’s vote, it is not clear when House speaker Nancy Pelosi will transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate, and she has not yet appointed impeachment managers, who will effectively act like prosecutors during proceedings. Pelosi says she is waiting for indications that the trial will be “fair.” Lawmakers will break for the holidays on Friday, meaning if she does not act fast, she will have to wait until next year.\nTangent: What else did Putin say?\n");

With over 40 years’ experience with the De Beers Group, he is responsible for setting the standard for all the diamonds used in De Beers’ jewellery, ensuring they are always cut for beauty rather than weight. He started out as a buyer of rough diamonds in Africa in 1972 and almost 20 years ago, was involved in implementing the Kimberley Process that was set up to stop the trade in conflict stones.Andrew recently took a moment out from his world travels to share with Vogue five little-known facts about the world's hardest, sparkliest mineral.\n\n\n 1.No two diamonds are the same \n Natural diamonds are one of the oldest and rarest of nature’s treasures, formed through intense heat and pressure in the earth’s mantle between 800 million and 3.4 billion years ago. They are older than some of the stars in the sky and nature only has a limited supply. Because they were born at different times during the evolution of the earth, they all look and feel very different. They develop a unique character and colour, depending on the surrounding conditions in which they were initially created under, as well as their secret journey from over 300 kilometres beneath the surface of the earth. This makes each diamond truly unique.\n\n 2.You can trust your own eyes\nDiamonds will excite your eyes in different ways as you see the same diamond differently from each eye. The three aspects of visual excitement in a diamond is described by De Beers as Fire, Life and Brilliance. However, the combination that will excite you the most is completely unique to you.Trust your eye, brain and ultimately, your heart’s reaction. At De Beers, we advocate having a very open mind about the 4 Cs - cut, clarity, colour and carat weight - and recommend trying on everything within your ring size and budget regardless of colour, shape, or quality grade. Be prepared for a big surprise! In a sense, the diamond chooses you and when that happens, there is only one thing left to do: fall in love with your diamond for you have found the best one in the world.\n\n 3.The magical history of natural diamonds\nWhen rough diamonds were first found in India over 2,500 years ago, some people felt a mystical power when they touched a diamond. Always cold and hard, they were considered unconquerable, especially as a diamond was so hard that it could not be polished or faceted like other gemstones. In fact, it was only 500 years ago that a way to polish a diamond was found. Rough diamonds were worn as talismans by kings and princes for 2000 years, often sewn into their clothes to protect them in battle.It was only later that diamonds became a symbol of love and the idea of the engagement ring was born. One medieval example of a diamond ring in France was engraved with the words ‘When you do not see me, please think of me.’ Today, the meaning that diamonds convey, continues to evolve, each one as individual as those who either gift a diamond or purchase it to enjoy themselves.\n\n4.Diamonds are really cool\nDiamonds are the coolest gemstones to touch because heat goes in and out of them faster than with any other stone. Diamonds are also the hardest mineral, not only the highest-scoring 10 on the Mohs scale of hardness, but actually four times harder than anything else on earth. Interestingly they do not conduct electricity which may explain why many people constantly touch their diamond jewellery while thinking\n\n 5.Diamonds make the world a sparklier place, but it’s important to treat them with care\nFor most people, the best diamond is the one which sparkles the most but unless you wear the silk glove which you see worn by jewellers, you can reduce the natural transparency and sparkle of your diamond in seconds, every time you handle it with your bare hands. Science tells us that hydrocarbons, oils and greases are naturally attracted to surfaces which do not contain oxygen. Diamond is pure carbon so it provides the perfect surface to stick to — like glue. Professional cleaning by your jeweller is the best way to restore your ring, better than gin, washing up liquid or your ex’s toothbrush. Once you buy a piece of De Beers diamond jewellery, we offer cleaning for life, and if you want to sparkle up your diamond on the go, we recommend using our Instant Diamond Brilliance wipes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t ARTICLE 2 for FASHION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \t\tEvery Romantic Detail Of Note From JFK And Jackie Kennedy’s Wedding  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t BY EMILY CHAN \n\t\t\t\t18 DECEMBER 2019\n\nAs society weddings go, John F Kennedy’s marriage to Jacqueline Lee Bouvier is truly legendary. The future president met the socialite at a dinner party while she was working as the Washington Times-Herald’s “Inquiring Camera Girl” shortly after she graduated from George Washington University in 1951. (A little known fact? That same year, she also won Vogue’s Prix de Paris contest for young writers, the same prize that landed Joan Didion her first job at the magazine in 1956.) The couple dated quietly for two years before JFK, then a Massachusetts senator, proposed shortly after Jackie had returned from covering Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation in London. Below, look back at every detail of the spectacular wedding that followed.\n\nThe Ring\nJackie Kennedy’s engagement ring is one of the most referenced in history. The art-deco Van Cleef & Arpels design included a 2.88-carat diamond and a 2.84-carat emerald – both square cut and surrounded by diamond baguettes. In 1962, the then First Lady had the ring altered, incorporating round and marquise diamonds as well. For the wedding itself, Jackie also wore a diamond and pearl bracelet, gifted to her by JFK the night before the ceremony as her “something new”, as well as a strand of family pearls and a diamond leaf pin given to her by her in-laws.\n\nThe Wedding Party\nThe young senator’s best man was his brother Robert F Kennedy, with an additional 13 ushers – each of whom he presented with a Brooks Brothers umbrella inscribed with the date of the wedding during a rehearsal dinner at Newport’s Seaside Clambake Club. Jackie, on the other hand, had sister Lee Radziwill as her matron-of-honour, with a further 10 bridesmaids, all dressed in pink faille silk dresses and matching Tudor caps. Her stepfather, Hugh D Auchincloss, gave her away.\n\nThe Ceremony\nThe Kennedys were officially married at St Mary’s in Newport, Rhode Island, on the morning of 12 September, 1953, with the Catholic church filled with pink gladioli and white chrysanthemums for the occasion. The Archbishop of Boston performed the ceremony in front of no less than 800 guests, reading a special blessing from Pope Pius XII himself, while thousands of fans waited outside the church, hoping to see the bride and groom. A tenor soloist, Luigi Vena, performed Ave Maria during the service.\n\nThe Wedding Dress\n Jackie turned to Ann Lowe, the trailblazing African American designer, to create her ivory silk taffeta wedding dress, which included a portrait neckline and a bouffant skirt made with more than 50 yards of fabric. Meanwhile, she opted to wear her grandmother’s heirloom rose point lace veil, held in place by clusters of orange blossoms, and carried a bouquet of pink and white spray orchids and gardenias.\n\nThe Reception\nFollowing the ceremony, the bride and groom travelled with a motorcycle escort to the Auchincloss family’s 300-acre estate, Hammersmith Farm, where guests sipped champagne and danced to Meyer Davis and his orchestra against the backdrop of Narragansett Bay. According to a Life reporter sent to cover the event, “The marriage of Washington’s best-looking young senator to Washington’s prettiest inquiring photographer… turned out to be the most impressive the old society stronghold had seen in 30 years… There were 900 guests at the reception, and it took Senator and Mrs Kennedy two hours to shake their hands.” As for the couple’s grand exit for their honeymoon in Acapulco, Mexico? Guests showered the bride and groom with rose petal confetti.\n\nThe Menu\nJFK ordered a five-tier wedding cake from the family-run Plourdes Bakery in Massachusetts, which he frequently visited during his campaign for Senate in 1952 – with the finished product measuring nearly three feet tall. The wedding luncheon also included a fruit salad served in hollowed out pineapple halves; creamed chicken; and ice cream, carved into the shape of roses, for pudding.");

The finished result of her festive manicure called to mind a wrapped and ready holiday gift.It’s an easy look to recreate, too. Try a red like Essie's Scarlet Starlet with CND’s Vinylux Longwear Polish in Emerald Lights to achieve a similar effect.However, it wasn’t only Swift’s nails that tapped into the festive season and offered Christmas party beauty inspiration. Her bright red lip, a Swift signature, was stamped on that little bit brighter than usual, and was paired with a very Cats-appropriate feline flick of eyeliner plus an Oscar de la Renta dress.A purr-fect look, by all accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE:2 for BEAUTY\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKendall Jenner’s Signature Dark Locks Are No More\n\t\t\t\t\tBY HANNAH COATES\n\t\t\t\t\t17 DECEMBER 2019\n\n\nWhile most opt to go that little bit darker with their hair for winter, Kendall Jenner has taken her brunette mane a lighter shade of brown just in time for Christmas. Debuting the new hue in an Instagram video on Monday, Jenner ran her hands through her freshly coloured hair.\nA few shades lighter than her usual raven locks, the new coffee-brown hue is a natural one – more sun-kissed than lightened-in-salon – and Jenner paired it with the ultimate matte red lipstick and the caption, “I’m sleepy”.The woman behind her new colour is Cassondra Kaeding, a Redken brand ambassador who works out of Los Angeles’s 454 Salon, and who has dyed the hair of everyone from Natalie Portman to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.The subtle revamp is a far cry from the platinum blonde the model showed off back in September whilst walking the Burberry spring/summer 2020 show, a dramatic look she quickly eschewed to return to her hair comfort zone: the dark side.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSelena Gomez Demonstrates The Transformative Power Of A Good Fringe\n\t\t\t\t\tBY HANNAH COATES\n\t\t\t\t\t12 DECEMBER 2019\n\n\nThey say when in a city, do as the inhabitants do, and when Selena Gomez touched down in London this week, that is exactly what she did. Well, with her hair, that is.\nWith new wispy bangs, worn parted at the centre, and a choppy, layered, shoulder-length bob, Gomez stepped out with hair that was much reminiscent of a certain Briton, Alexa Chung.\nThe ‘shag’, which was cut by hairstylist Marissa Marino especially for Gomez’s trip to London, was expertly feathered around her face; both flattering and sophisticated at once, it framed Gomez’s face immaculately and disproved the myth that those with round-shaped faces can't pull off a fringe. Hers was a shining example that it can.During various outings in the British capital, she wore her fringe with everything from double denim to a Burberry black, leopard print-lined trench coat and she was rarely without her ‘70s-style Ray Bans.");

For Stormzy, the pressure to meet expectations is arguably greater than most, as his 2017 studio debut, Gangs, Signs & Prayer received raving reviews from critics, broke UK streaming records (earning 13.9 million streams in its first week to be exact), was named as one of only four artists to have had all tracks from an album rank in the UK top 100 (seven of which held solid places in the top 40 for consecutive weeks), was crowned the first grime album to make UK number one and went on to win the prestigious British Album of the Year award in 2018.\nGangs, Signs & Prayer was no doubt a magisterial masterpiece that saw Stormzy make his mark in the music industry and in history. What, how, and if the 26 year-old would deliver with his next album, titled Heavy Is The Head since its announcement was a hot topic of discussion amongst critics and fans alike. Ahead of the album released today, Vogue listened to all sixteen tracks from start and finish, and we can confirm that it is just, if not more masterful than his first.

Here is everything you need to know about the grime extraordinaire’s latest opus.\nEvery track is an anthem\nThe sixteen track album is a symphonious, triumphant affair, as Stormzy pushes his own musical and emotional boundaries, showcasing the many flavours and layers to his musical ability. Surprisingly, the album is dominated by tracks that one wouldn’t necessarily consider ‘quintessentially ‘Stormzy’ (upbeat, head bopping-inducing grime with heavy instrumentals and provocative lyrics), which if anything, is the album’s strength. Instead, a focus on tonality, musicality, instrumentals and vocals is clear, as he unexpectedly experiments with melding genres such as R&B, pop, soul, nineties/noughties sounds – even sampling hip-hop, jazz, gospel with rap and grime – a daring move that has paid off as it is these tracks that are his finest and far from a commercial sellout move. Each song carries a different musical theme, but are all grand in their own right, seamlessly flowing from one another. No doubt every track, as they did on Gangs, Signs & Prayer will make its way to the charts.");

A hidden jewel in Milan, the museum was founded by Cardinal Borromeo in 1609 on the principle of “doing it for the public,” as Gabbana explained. “He started to collect books around the world to give the people the possibility to learn about everything in the world. And this is the best message: we can work to give something to the people, not just for ourselves.”One of the first pieces in Borromeo’s collection was a still life painting of a fruit bowl by Caravaggio – “Canestra di Frutta” – which Dolce and Gabbana transferred onto a cape with an astrakhan collar for the second look in the collection, preceded by a scarlet cassock in homage to the collector himself. This was a literal collection, and that was precisely the point. “Classic beauty,” Dolce said. “We need beauty to make life better.” Renaissance art, of course, is the gift that keeps on giving. Anyone who seeks out the Italian museums that house the masterpieces and the secrets of this era will know that you can never be educated enough about – or overwhelmed enough with – the works of the Renaissance. For Dolce and Gabbana, their most recent obsession came courtesy of Giovanni Battista Moroni, who features within the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana and perhaps most notably painted the “The Tailor”, which belongs to the National Gallery.Parts of the 115 looks that made up the Alta Sartoria collection were inspired by Moroni. And while many of these clothes operate in hyper-opulence – gilded embroideries with gems and cloths printed like painted Renaissance canvases – it was in the sophistication of delicately coloured tailoring (and especially a handful of pristine coats that navigated within dusty royal blues and purples) that Moroni’s genetics were most beautifully communicated and interpreted for contemporary times. Alta Sartoria, though, isn’t about the simplicity of an instantly desirable cashmere coat. This “men’s couture” collection is a theatre for the private dandy client, who communicates his modern majesty through the intricate, almost impossible-looking craftsmanship of his clothes. That premise sets some delightful challenges for Dolce and Gabbana on a seasonal basis.This time, they created new trompe l’oeils with plume in neatly storied quills on tops and tailoring – so three-dimensional the effect flickered before your eyes – and in a wealth of fur techniques that played on intarsia impacts or metallic dyes that created optical illusions. It was a feast for the eyes of the client, who flies himself to these shows to buy his seasonal multi-gazillionaire wardrobe. For the rest of us, it was the kind of fashion you just have to sit back and enjoy: so sensorily stimulating you’d be silly not to surrender to its lavishness, much like visiting a Renaissance palazzo or indulging in a princely banquet. “We love for the new man to have a vision about beauty and art,” Gabbana said. Whether you’d want to wear it or not, hang it on your wall, or just marvel as its intricacy, his and Dolce’s message was hard to resist.\nby ANDERS CHRISTIAN MADSEN");

While running errands in the city, she opted for a sleek satin suit in the sugary shade with a raspberry shirt underneath. She offset her blush tailoring with a camel coat (a current celeb go-to), a red croc bag, beige pumps, large gold hoops and tinted shades.\nChopra has incorporated a handful of immaculately cut suits into her wardrobe of late. Earlier this month at the Marrakech International Film Festival, the actor, who was honoured for her contribution to film over the past 20 years, wore white Prabal Gurung separates, which she contrasted with a berry-stained lip. The star – who is currently filming The White Tiger, an adaptation of Aravind Adiga’s Man Booker prize-winning novel of the same title – has worn pieces by Gurung on several occasions, but suiting by the Nepalese-American designer is new for the star.\nLooking ahead to next year, Chopra and her husband Nick Jonas are teaming up to produce an unscripted series for Amazon, which will follow engaged couples as they prepare for their Sangeets. In short, a Sangeet occurs the night before a wedding and involves family and friends dancing the night away. “We re-watched the video of our Sangeet last week on our first anniversary, and the togetherness of our family and friends during this event still sparks the same warmth and excitement that it did just over a year ago at our wedding,” said Chopra Jonas of her Indian wedding last year. “The Sangeet is a centuries-old Indian wedding tradition, that not only celebrates the union of two people, but also signifies the introduction and bonding of two families coming together in a marriage.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE: 2 for NEWS\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJennifer Lawrence Wears Another Trophy Coat For A Day At The Museum\n\t\t\t\t\tBY SUSAN DEVANEY\n\t\t\t\t\t18 DECEMBER 2019\n\n ver the winter months, Jennifer Lawrence has been using a luxurious pale palette to elevate her daywear.

Yesterday, she took Burberry’s yellow “Willingstone” teddy coat for a spin at the MET Museum. Underneath? A light grey turtleneck, monochrome plaid skirt, a pair of The Row combat boots (her current staple) and a Khaite “Aimee” clutch in caramel suede.\nLawrence and her husband Cooke Maroney, who split their time between New York and Los Angeles, strolled through the streets of NYC arm-in-arm. The Hunger Games star and her art dealer partner recently exchanged vows at a lavish ceremony in Newport, Rhode Island. Lawrence, who reportedly wore Dior for the big day, said “I do” during a service at the Belcourt of Newport mansion, a 40,000sq ft estate with a sprawling ballroom space. Celebrities such as Cameron Diaz, Kris Jenner, Adele, Nicole Richie and Emma Stone were in attendance.\nLike Lawrence, Katie Holmes has also been wearing a cosy teddy coat this winter.

Now, the actor is sharing one book in particular: Little Women.\nPictured carrying a Bottletop enamel electric blue bag, Watson shared more about the initiative in an Instagram post: “I'm excited to reveal a global effort with @bookfairiesworldwide to hide 2,000 copies of Little Women! #LWBookFairies starts today and features over a hundred different editions of Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel to celebrate the release of #LittleWomenMovie…” And the best part? Each copy contains a hidden handwritten note from Watson herself. In total 38 countries are involved, making this the largest Book Fairies event ever.");

The company refers to Snapdragon 865 as a “mobile platform” solution because indeed, in conjunction with its Snapdragon X55 modem, it provides a comprehensive flagship 5G smartphone silicon solution, from core processors to the to modem, RF transceiver and RF front end, that’s both mmWave (Millimeter Wave) and Sub-6 compatible for operation with virtually any carrier network. 5G interoperability is a must-have for any next generation flagship mobile device, but so-too is top end performance. To that end, Qualcomm also re-architected the primary processing engines on board the Snapdragon 865 such that the company is claiming a healthy 25 percent performance uplift in core compute and gaming/graphics workloads, along with up to a 4X increase in TOPS performance in AI workloads, coupled with higher efficiency to boot.Snapdragon 865's new Kryo 585 CPU engine is comprised of a quad-core, high-performance arm Cortex-A77 complex, along with a quad-core block of low-power arm Cortex-A55 cores. One of the Cortex-A77 cores, dubbed the Prime core has a beefed-up 512K of L2 cache and also a higher boost clock than the other high performance cores, at 2.8GHz versus 2.4GHz. The Prime core is intended to bolster single-threaded workloads to improve general responsiveness. This big/little architecture has been common among arm mobile silicon solutions for many years but arm’s 64-bit Cortex-A77 is new this year, offering wider instruction fetch (6-wide up from 4-wide), increased memory bandwidth and other enhancements.  One additional take-away here is that Qualcomm is obviously focused on balanced performance, not only multithreaded, but single-threaded responsiveness as well.Qualcomm didn’t dive too deep on its new Adreno 650 GPU engine, except to note that it will deliver up to 25 percent more performance, but Snapdragon 865 also supports up to 16GB of 2750MHz LPDDR5 memory for a nice kicker in memory bandwidth, which is always key for graphics-intensive workloads. Finally, machine learning at the edge, or EdgeML, is big these days, as mobile and smart IoT devices need to gather, analyze and quantify more data than ever before. As such, QCOM also introduced its new Hexagon 698 AI processing engine in Snapdragon 865, with enhanced Tensor processing cores for the AI lift I noted earlier. All told, it appears as if Snapdragon 865 will allow the Android army to give the other major mobile device platforms, from Apple to Huawei, a run for their money, but how do all these speeds, feeds and core counts translate to real world performance?Marco Chiappetta over at HotHardware has an early preview look of Snapdragon 865 performance with an advanced prototype provided by Qualcomm for testing. The 5.9-inch device was running Android 10 and was also backed up by 12GB of LPDDR5 and 128GB of internal Flash storage. The device had two modes of operation, Normal and Performance, the latter of which allows Snapdragon 865 the ability to ramp up quicker, moving workloads from its little arm cores to its big arm Cortex-A77 cores.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE 2: for INNOVATION\n\n\n\t\tCanva Uncovered: How A Young Australian Kitesurfer Built A $3.2 Billion (Profitable!) Startup Phenom\n\non a steamy May morning in 2013, Canva CEO Melanie Perkins found herself adrift on a kiteboard in the channel between billionaire Richard Branson’s private Necker and Moskito islands.Her 30-foot sail floating deflated and useless beside her in the strong eastern Caribbean current, the 26-year-old entrepreneur waited for hours to be rescued. As she treaded water, her left leg scarred by a past collision with a coral reef, she reminded herself that her dangerous new hobby was worth it. After all, it was key to the fundraising strategy for the design-software startup she’d cofounded with her boyfriend six years before.Canva was based in Australia, thousands of miles from tech’s Silicon Valley power corridor. Getting a meeting—much less funding—was proving tough. Perkins heard “no” from more than 100 investors. So when she met the organizer of a group of kitesurfing venture capitalists at a pitch competition in her native Perth, Perkins got to training. The next time the group met to hear startup pitches and potentially write crucial early-stage funding checks, she’d have a seat at the table—even if it meant having to brave treacherous waters.“It was like, risk: serious damage; reward: start company,” Perkins says. If you get your foot in the door just a tiny bit, you have to kind of wedge it all the way in.\nSuch perseverance has long been a necessity at Canva, which began as a modest yearbook-design business in the state capital of Perth on Australia’s west coast. From those remote origins, Canva has grown into a global juggernaut. Twenty-million-plus users from 190 countries use the company’s “freemium” Web-based app to design everything from splashy Pinterest graphics to elegant restaurant menus. Besides an impossible-to-beat price (millions of users pay nothing at all), Canva’s key advantage over rival products from tech giants like Adobe has been its ease of use. Before Canva, amateurs had to stitch together designs in Microsoft Word or pay through the nose for confusing professional tools. Today, anyone, anywhere, can download Canva and be creating within ten minutes. The company’s revenue comes from upselling to a $10-a-month premium version with snazzier features or, more recently, from sales of a streamlined corporate account option. High-quality stock photos—of which Canva has millions—cost another $1. It adds up. This year the company expects to more than double its revenue to $200 million; its most recent $85 million funding round valued it at $3.2 billion. Perkins, now 32 and an alum of the 2016 Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list, has an estimated 15% stake, valued at $430 million. Throw in her 34-year-old cofounder—and now fiancé—Cliff Obrecht’s similar stake, and the Aussie power couple are likely worth more than $800 million.\nSuch perseverance has long been a necessity at Canva, which began as a modest yearbook-design business in the state capital of Perth on Australia’s west coast.

                    printf("\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE:1 for OFFICE:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn A Historic Bill, Federal Workers Will Receive 12 Weeks Of Paid Parental Leave\n\nIn the bizarre way that the United States government works, the Senate passed a bill on Tuesday, tucked into the budget of the National Defense Authorization Act (authorizing a new Space Force branch of the Armed Services), providing all federal workers with 12 weeks of paid parental leave for the first time in American history.The bill, which was lightly covered in the media due to the impeachment hearings, will offer all federal workers 12 weeks of paid parental leave—coinciding with the birth, adoption or fostering of a child. First passed by Congress and this week’s vote in the Senate, the bill will now be brought before President Donald Trump to sign. This monumental policy will commence in October 2020. Federal employees will need to work for the U.S. government for at least a year to become eligible for the benefits. They will also have to return back to work for at least 12 weeks after they take their leave. The initial version of the bill called for also providing paid time off for employees who need to care for sick adult relatives or tend to their own medical issues. However, this draft did not garner sufficient bipartisan support.The U.S. is unique in that it's the sole industrialized nation that has refused to adopt a policy of parental leave for its federal employees up to this point. The U.S. currently has the Family Medical Leave Act, which requires employers with 50 and more employees to give parents 12 weeks of leave to care for a new child. The corporations are not mandated to offer any guaranteed pay for their employees who take time off from work. Over 2 million Americans are believed to benefit from this new policy. By comparison, only 19% of U.S. non-government workers have access to paid family leave through their employers. This gives rise to questions from some people over the fairness of the act. Is it appropriate for government employees, who are paid by taxpayers, to receive such an important benefit that is not widely offered to the majority of working people? The Congressional Budget Office estimates it could cost about $8.1 billion over the next 10 years—funded by workers who don’t have this right. This does not take away from the importance of the bill, but there should be some thought and consideration for those who are not fortunate enough to receive such a benefit.Similar policies have already been adopted by many large, leading companies in the U.S. The hope is that other corporations will follow the government’s lead and offer this benefit to their employees too. Wide adoption is questionable as many small-to-midsize organizations don’t have the financial and personnel resources to offer such a program—even if they wanted to. An unintended consequence may be that people will seek out jobs with the government or large, deep-pocketed companies and leave smaller firms. This will put more power into the hands of companies, such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple and the U.S. government, while weakening smaller companies that are unable to offer this program. They will most likely lose their best and brightest employees to their bigger rivals.  It is expected for Trump to sign the bill, as his daughter, Ivanka Trump, was a prominent proponent of the bill. Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Representative Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), the new chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, have all championed this cause.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE :2 for LEADERSHIP:\n\n\n\t\tCollege Enrollment Declines Again. It’s Down More Than Two Million Students In This Decade.\n\nThe fall 2019 postsecondary enrollment numbers have been tabulated, and the news is once again sure to concern college leaders. Overall, postsecondary enrollments decreased by 1.3% in fall 2019, a drop of more than 231,000 students from last year. That’s according to the the Fall 2019 Current Term Enrollment Estimates report from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. (Institutions that submit enrollment data to the Clearinghouse account for 97% of all enrollments at Title IV, degree-granting institutions.For the first time this decade, the nation’s fall semester’s unduplicated enrollments dipped below 18 million, a decline of more than 2 million students since its peak in 2011.Added to that top-line result are several findings that provide specific insights into where the decreases (and some increases) are occurring.Fifteen states saw enrollment increases. Utah led the nation with an increase of nearly 16,800 students, a 4.9% uptick from last year. The other states with enrollment increases were: Arizona (1.8%), Delaware (0.3%), Georgia (1.5%), Kentucky (1.5%), Louisiana (0.6%), Mississippi (0.3%), Nebraska (0.4%), Nevada (0.3%), New Hampshire (3.4%), North Carolina (0.6%), Rhode Island (0.3%), South Carolina (0.1%), Tennessee (0.6%), and Texas (0.3%).The remaining states suffered enrollment decreases.Florida had the largest decline with a drop of 52,328 students. It was followed by New York (-19,386), California (-19,272), Missouri (-14,869) and Pennsylvania (-14,799).In terms of percentage decreases, the top states were: Alaska (-10.6%), Florida (-5.3%), Arkansas (-4.9%), Missouri (-4.4%), Wyoming (-4.4%) and Vermont (-4.4%).\nAll sectors experienced declines.Among higher education sectors, the largest percentage decrease was at private for-profit four-year institutions, which shrunk by 15,711 students or 2.1%. It was followed by public two-year institutions, where enrollment declined by 77,092 students or 1.4%; public four-year institutions, whose enrollment dropped by 97,426 students or 1.2%; and private nonprofit four-year institutions, which fell by 22,027 students, 0.6%.The report noted that enrollment at large private nonprofit four-year institutions actually grew 2.7%, although those with less than 10,000 students declined.\nGraduate and professional education saw a small enrollment increase.While undergraduate enrollment decreased by 1.7% year over year, graduate and professional enrollment edged up by .8% from 2018 to 2019.\nEnrollment declines were greater for men, part-timers and older students. \nAbout 159,000 fewer men (-2.0%) and nearly 84,000 fewer women (-.8%) enrolled in 2019 compared to 2018.Enrollment decreases were more than twice as large for part-time students (-2.1%) compared to those attending full-time (-.9%).Enrollment declined 1% for students between the ages of 18 and 24, but it dived by 6% for students older than 24. One bit of good news was that enrollment of dual-enrolled students under the age of 18 increased by 36,660, almost 6%, at public two-year colleges. The average age of full-time, undergraduate students has dropped from 22.3 to 21.8 years over the past four years.\nSTEM majors saw declines as did the humanities.Enrollments continued to slide downward in English (-5%) and liberal arts and sciences, general studies and the humanities (-7.1%), but what was less expected were decreases in several STEM majors, which are typically seen as better pathways to good job prospects. Four-year majors in health sciences were off by 2.1%, as were majors in physical sciences -4.6 science technologies -2.6%, engineering (-1.6%), math (-1.2%), biological sciences (-.9%).\nImplicationsIf anyone needed further proof that higher education continues to battle strong headwinds, these enrollment numbers should suffice. A shrinking population of high school graduates combined with a spate of institutional scandals, widespread anxiety about the costs of college and mountains of student debt, increasing skepticism about the value and necessity of college, growing concerns about the fairness of the admissions process, and a widening partisan divide between Republicans and Democrats over whether colleges are politically biased have taken a toll on Americans’ perceptions—and their participation—in college.The problem of sagging enrollments should not be dismissed merely as a demographic inevitability or a failure of higher education to tell its story well. It’s more than bad messaging. Colleges and universities have work to do to regain the public’s confidence. Here are four areas where they could start:Work with governors and state legislatures to design effective performance funding models, where public institutions are funded not merely for larger enrollments, but for achieving desirable goals like greater retention, better student learning, and increased degree completion. Commitments to performance funding must also be matched by states appropriating more funding for their public colleges.Revamp institutional financial aid so that all, or most of it, is distributed on the basis of students’ financial need, rather than what’s deemed to be “merit,” simplistically equated with standardized test scores and high-school grades. These days almost every college president stresses the importance of “making college affordable,” but if they aren’t spending most of their financial aid dollars helping students with financial need, they aren’t putting their money where their message is.Reduce the subsidy that nearly all institutions annually plow into intercollegiate athletic programs. All but a couple dozen institutions lose money—and lots of it—on intercollegiate athletics. Whether alumni and donors like it or not, subsidies for college sports are not sustainable, and they are draining hundreds of millions of dollars away from the educational investments that colleges could otherwise be making.Make undergraduate learning an institutional priority. As important as original scholarship and community service are, the primary mission of colleges should be to educate undergraduates well, coupling high academic standards and rigorous curricula with strong support services that prepare graduates for successful lives and productive careers. The general public may not always fully appreciate research and service activities by our colleges and universities, but they will accept them as long as they don’t come at the expense of putting students first.");

                    printf("\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE:1 for CULTURE:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Real Story Behind The PNC-Venmo Clash\n\nOBSERVATIONS FROM THE FINTECH SNARK TANKFinextra reported that “PNC Bank has been inundated with complaints from customers who have been left unable to connect their accounts to the Venmo app after a security update from the bank locked out data aggregator Plaid.”The bank’s response to complaints and requests for help:\nWhy is PNC doing this? According to its head of retail banking, When aggregators access account numbers, many store them indefinitely, often unbeknownst to customers. This puts customers and their money at risk. We want to make sure we know who is setting up the account.\nWhat The Media Thinks the Story Is\nReactions to PNC’s move have focused mostly on data aggregation and open banking:Finextra wrote: “The dispute is part of a wider battle between banks and fintech upstarts over access to customer data. Plaid has grown into a multi-billion dollar company in just few years by tapping into increasing consumers demand to share their bank data with third party apps.”Quoted in a CNBC article, Karen Mills, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School said “the PNC-Venmo spat shows how much we need to adopt open banking that lets customers own their own data.The Media is WrongPNC may be correct about the risk involved in data aggregators’ data management approaches. But the bank is a member of the Financial Data Exchange which is committed to “enhancing consumer controls of financial data through an API and technical standards that prioritize security, transparency and user experience.”\nIn other words, PNC is committed to sharing data and “open banking.”Venmo-related security concerns is a bit of a red herring, however.\nIn October 2018, American Banker reported that “one banker said that soon after his firm launched Zelle, fraud skyrocketed so high he had to go into the office at midnight to shut the system down.”And in fact, PNC struggled itself with Zelle-related fraud. A May 2018 Digital Transactions article reported that Zelle-related “hit double digit basis points of payment volume” for a period of time.The bank was able to take steps to reduce the fraud rate. But that begs the question: If PNC can take corrective actions, why can’t the data aggregators?\nThe Real Story\nTo Finextra’s point, there is a battle over access to customer data. But that’s not what’s going on here. And while open banking might enable consumers to own their own data (or at least better manage their data), that, too, is not what the PNC-Venmo spat is all about.\nWhat the story is about is Zelle’s quest for P2P payment dominance.\nAs I wrote earlier this year in Venmo Versus Zelle: Who's Winning The P2P Payments War?, consumers who use P2P payment apps typically use multiple services—and they’ll choose the app that is most convenient for them at the moment they want to transact.That’s not good enough for Zelle, or for PNC, apparently.The bank is betting that its customers will switch P2P providers before they switch checking accounts. Considering the pain involved with switching accounts, this might not be a bad bet.\nWill Other Zelle Banks Follow Suit?\nTwo weeks ago, JPMorgan Chase announced an agreement with data aggregator Envestnet | Yodlee to share data—but give Chase customers better control over it.This comes a little more than a year after the bank announced a data sharing deal with Plaid to enable customers to more easily share data outside the bank.Seemingly committed to data sharing and “open banking,” will Chase shut down connections to Plaid (and therefore Venmo)? Will other Zelle banks follow suit?They’ll be watching what happens with PNC, for sure. If PNC sees limited account attrition, other Zelle banks will be likely to follow.Never Underestimate Consumer Ingenuit \nIf Zelle banks do shut down access to Plaid in order to subvert Venmo, they may win the P2P battle, but might end up losing the banking war.Here’s my bet: PNC will see very little account attrition resulting from the bank’s actions.To be sure, some customers will change their P2P payment preferences.but many others will simply open additional checking accounts with the Chimes and Money Lions of the world—while leaving their PNC accounts open.They’ll move money from PNC to those other players via ACH or other methods—and continue using Venno through those accounts.And who knows, maybe they’ll start using those fintech firms’ debit cards, as well.Zelle’s quest for dominance is going to have some interesting consequences.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE:2 for business:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReview: ‘Cats’ Is Every Bit As Terrible And Wonderful As You Hoped\n\nLook, Cats is a relatively faithful adaptation of Cats. The Andrew Lloyd Weber musical, based on on T.S. Eliot’s 1939 poetry collection Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats was arguably the first modern “blockbuster” musical of its era. It was as popular for as long as it was not entirely because of quality. It offered stage-bound spectacle and fantasy, with ridiculously talented performers singing and dancing as humanoid cats. It was the one show to which everyone could take their kids, especially tourists wanting to expose their youngsters to a Broadway show.Folks have been making fun of Cats, its lack of a coherent narrative, its random digressions, its frankly mediocre songs (save for maybe “Memories”) and its sheer absurdity for at least as long as it has existed. So, when I say that Tom Hooper’s Cats absolutely captures what’s great and terrible about the show, you can take that for what it’s worth.Yes, Cats is every bit as incomprehensible on screen as it was in theaters. It was the kind of show where I (as a kid) had a theater program synopsis sitting in front of me and still struggled to discern what was happening at any given moment. That I’m not inclined to bend over backward to be fair to this unquestionably unique bit of cinema lunacy is partially because the songs aren’t great, and thus the film isn’t terrible engrossing over the long haul\nIt’s one thing when you’re The Greatest Showman and your songs are so damn catchy that I can still hum them two years later. Save for one or two exceptions, the Cats tunes have always been the opposite of ear worms. Yes, ‘Memories” is great, and I was always fond of Macavity Mr. Mistoffelees. But these aren’t Weber’s best songs, and this certainly isn’t his most disciplined narrative.The hook is pretty simple: several cats existing in some kind of cat purgatory (Are they already dead? I’m not sure.) explain their life stories via song in the hopes that they will be the one chosen to be reincarnated and hopefully have a better life than they did last time. That’s laid out pretty succinctly in the opening reel, and then we’re off to the races. What follows isn’t so much a narrative as it is (like the stage play) a series of almost stand-alone musical numbers where each main cat (played by the likes of Rebel Wilson, James Cordon, Ian McKellen and Jennifer Hudson) gets their turn to make their case.Francesca Hayward plays our audience surrogate while Judi Dench is the one who will choose the winner, and Idris Elba plays the villainous Macavity. Macavity’s big song, sung not by the villain himself but by his proverbial Harley Quinn, goes to Taylor Swift. She also wrote a surprisingly good new tune, “Beautiful Ghosts,” which is Hayward’s big power ballad.\nOn one hand, Swift shows up just long enough to get one of the best songs, but she also generously (?) co-wrote a strong number for someone else. Come what may, it’s better than any of the “new” songs in Aladdin or The Lion King. Anyway, in terms of acting, everyone is having a grand old time, but McKellen stands out by taking it quite seriously. He’s like Michael Caine in A Christmas Carol giving 104% even while acting alongside the Muppets. Elba has his fun too, while Hudson is there strictly to belt “Memories.”This all plays out with actors singing and dancing as living cats thanks to the magic of special effects. Is this 100% authentic? No, but it mostly sells the illusion and looks about as real as you’re going to get without turning this into The Lion King. The production design, even with an inconsistency of scale worthy of Night of the Lepus, is amusing and occasionally enchanting, with the cats in question floundering about amid giant real world sets that sometimes looks like a very expensive episode of Sesame Street.Whether you think Cats is rum-tum-terrific or rum-tum-terrible is largely about whether you have any interest in a Cats movie. I imagine many of my fellow critics, especially those with little knowledge of the stage play, reacted in horror and amazement, and this flick is almost certain to become a camp classic along the lines of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Again, this is not a “good” movie, but it’s a faithful rendition, warts and all, of a stage property that ran for decades. If you wanted a star-studded Cats movie, well, here you go.");

Croatia\nToday In: Lifestyle\nAccording to Virtuoso, a luxury travel network with a reputation for accurately forecasting travel trends, Croatia is one of its top emerging destinations for the upcoming year. Croatia offers a range of activities and you should definitely try to see as much of the country as possible while there.The capital of Croatia, Zagreb, is located inland and encompasses a medieval town and many museums. Meanwhile, the coastal Dubrovnik, possibly more well known as a shooting location for Game of Thrones, offers lovely architecture from a range of eras. \n2. Antarctica\nAs travel to all corners of the globe becomes more accessible, you might find yourself considering destinations that you’d never thought of before, such as Antarctica. New tour providers, cruises and more make visiting the icy adventure destination a possibility.It’s becoming popular with not only adventurers but families as well. Activities you can expect during an Antarctic expedition including penguin watching, whale watching, kayaking, camping, scuba diving and visits to Antarctic research stations. \n3. Bilbao\nBarcelona and Madrid have received traveler attention for a long time, but what about Bilbao, Spain? According to Airbnb, Bilbao has seen a 402 percent year-over-year increase in bookings. It’s attracting travelers not only thanks to its popular Guggenheim Museum but also with its sporting events, culinary scene and culture. Don’t think that the Guggenheim is the only museum the town offers, though.Try the Museum of Fine Arts of Bilbao as well. Make a stop at some of the city’s cathedrals and plenteous pintxos bars.\n4. Vanuatu \nYou may have never heard of this Pacific island chain before, but you will soon. Vanuatu is an archipelago located a few thousand miles east of Australia. The 80 islands boast 100 native languages and plenty of adventure activities to inspire intrepid travelers, including snorkeling, hiking, scuba diving and exploring the wreckage of World War II-era ships, like the SS President Coolidge.Of course, if you’re not up for an activity and would prefer to relax, you can do that, too, on the popular white, sandy beaches. Champagne Beach is a favorite for many visitors. \n5. Quadra Island\nSpeaking of intrepid travelers, brand Intrepid Travel analyzed its booking trends to predict some of the hottest destinations for 2020. It named Quadra Island, British Columbia, as one of the top places to visit in the coming year. The site off Vancouver Island is known as a premier place to whale watch, and there are plenty of tour providers that offer water activities such as kayaking.Camping and hiking are also popular, as is visiting the Cape Mudge Lighthouse. If you’re not too keen on outdoor activities, this trending travel spot might not be for you. But, you can still enjoy learning about the culture and history of Quadra Island at the Nuyumbalees Cultural Center. \n6. Benin\nWhen governments pour money into tourism, travelers do seem to follow. We’ve seen it with destinations such as Egypt and now we’re seeing it with Benin, West Africa. The country gave the world voodoo, but it offers more than just that cultural significance.You can also explore the historical museum in the capital of the long-standing Dahomey Kingdom (which existed for three hundred years), as well as the two historical royal palaces. One boasts a rather morbid attraction that some may enjoy — a throne made of human skulls. If you’d rather see the horrors (and wonders) of the animal kingdom than mankind, book a safari in the country’s Pendjari National Park.\n7. Salta\nBooking.com recognized Salta, Argentina, as a trending destination for 2020. The mountainous town offers something for every type of traveler. Those who are fans of urban exploration can enjoy the cultural hub and historic architecture, while adventurers and active explorers can venture outside the city to soak in the abundant nature and wildlife.One of the top spots in the city is Plaza 9 De Julia, a plaza that dates back to the 1500s, where you can find quaint cafes and museums. Don’t miss the Museum of High Altitude Archaeology, as well as the elegant cathedrals and convents.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tARTICLE:2 for LIFESTYLE:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFive Cars From The Last Decade That Were Ahead Of Their Time\n\nTiming is everything in the automotive industry. Constantly fluctuating gas prices, market preferences and an ever-advancing technological landscape mean that every move or investment into research and development towards something  “new” is a high-stakes gamble. Sure, right now, SUVs and crossovers are the safe bet profit margin-wise and manufactures are doubling down on those segments for that exact reason. The other side of that coin is when a brand unveils a model pioneering a certain ethos, design or technology with masterstroke potential only to have it fail. Somethings have their moment in the spotlight, fail and are never heard from again. Gullwing doors make a comeback every three decades or so, but innovations like the fifth-wheel parking concept or turbine engine cars are best left to the pages of history books. However, what has to hurt the most is when a car turns heads (for good or bad) upon release, then ceases production due to poor sales or reception, only to see similar cars come along a few years later and enjoy fantastic success. It’s the automotive equivalent of telling a funny joke in a group of friends, no one hearing you, then someone else says the exact same thing and gets the laughs. Just like delivering a punchline, timing is everything. These five cars from 2010-2019 missed the beat and were just too ahead of their time for their own good.\nHonda Accord Crosstour\nHonda branded it a “wagon,” but in person, the Honda Accord Crosstour seemed to slot in between a crossover and a standard wagon. The “sporty” sloped rear hatch made it a bit of an odd-ball in 2010 and because of slow sales, Honda gave it the Crosstour the ax in 2016. If Honda just waited three more years, it would’ve looked like a trendsetter. The Crosstour’s silhouette is now all the rage with luxury manufacturers. Some of the best selling models from BMW and Mercedes are Sedans, SUVs and crossovers sporting that weird-for-2016 coupe-like design. \nFirst Generation Tesla Roadster\nTesla has, without a doubt, single-handedly transformed the world’s perception of electric cars. They used to be uncompetitive and unattractive. Now, all-electric models are making their way into almost every luxury manufacturer’s line up and regularly bully gas-powered performance models on the track. And that’s all thanks to the Model S, Tesla’s second car. The Tesla Roadster is making a comeback in 2020, but the first generation Roadster which ran from 2008-2012, was the brand’s first attempt at making the electric car cool. It showed great potential but was ultimately the victim of the lesser battery technology at the time, sadly. \nCTS-V Sport Wagon\n ");

On this, Putin said: “They will be unlikely to remove a representative of their own party from office on what seems to me an absolutely far-fetched reason.”\nKey background: Last night, House Democrats, with two exceptions, voted to impeach Trump and passed two articles charging him with “high crimes and misdemeanors”: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats allege that Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, his potential rival for the presidency in 2020. They also accuse Trump of obstructing Congress, through his efforts to stop aides from testifying in private and public hearings that stretched over two months.\nWhat to watch for: 2020 is set to start with a Senate trial, which is expected to be fast and lead to an acquittal. But the journey to get there could result in a deadlock. Following yesterday’s vote, it is not clear when House speaker Nancy Pelosi will transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate, and she has not yet appointed impeachment managers, who will effectively act like prosecutors during proceedings. Pelosi says she is waiting for indications that the trial will be “fair.” Lawmakers will break for the holidays on Friday, meaning if she does not act fast, she will have to wait until next year.\nTangent: What else did Putin say?\n");
